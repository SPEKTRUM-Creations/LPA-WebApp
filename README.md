# LPA-WebApp


 
 Are you a developer? Join us for 
 a fun set of projects being developed
 by the team we will assemble through
 both the SCDN.SPEKTRUMCreations.com/ 
 website and the online community we 
 will start posting our development 
 project files to on the repositories 
 located and/or mirrored at 
 github.com/SPEKTRUM-Creations.

This "Long Play Album" WebApp is where we begin with long term goal of 
creating the file-type (.LPA) as the definitive Digital-LongPlayAlbum 
container to be developed as the standard means of distributing digital 
albums (with full contents, not just the music but lyrics, liners, 
credits and more such as artwork and video content even...).  The goal 
will be to leverage the SPKML Language as a part of the development of
the .LPA file-type, making both the language and the file-type standard
as essential to the musical world on the web...

To view an example of the code we are developing, check out,

Note: the actual mp3 file being used, contains chapters already and as the
goal is to include forward and back buttons to skip between songs in the single
file containing all of the album contents, it will come to pass that we will add
the next and previous track buttons to the music player interface...

 Details will follow soon, so please 
 stay tuned so you don't miss your 
 chance to help design code using 
 standard code to create new standards 
 of certain file type we've been 
 working on to open-source for this 
 community being called by the name:
 SPEKTRUM Creations Development Network.

   This is an .lpa file prototype 
   containing the example code and 
   structure for the file type for 
   the album contents format being 
   developed by SCDN, led by the 
   project lead and supported by

        SPKML.com is also his site.
        


  Note: The goal of this software’s development is to create a
  file type which acts as a container, that will be comprised of
  standardized and open-sourced code for use by anyone upon the
  release of the code, with accepting of terms by the user whom 
  may be interested in contributing to extensible additions or 
  more streamlined approaches, with a common goal to make this 
  code for use by musicians as well as by listeners for the goal
  of enhancing the ability of both parties to enjoy the final
  product, either presenting or being presented, and providing 
  a win-win scenario for everyone involved.  Please Contribute
  if you can but note that any changes you make to the overall
  code portion of these documents must be shared back to the 
  group of developers located hereforth at either site below:
