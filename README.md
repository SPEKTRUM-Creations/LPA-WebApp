 Are you a developer? Join us for 
 a fun set of projects being developed
 by the team we will assemble through
 both the SCDN.SPEKTRUMCreations.com/ 
 website and the online community we 
 will start posting our development 
 project files to on the repositories 
 located and/or mirrored at 
 github.com/SPEKTRUM-Creations.

This "Long Play Album" WebApp is where we begin with long term goal of 
creating the file-type (.LPA) as the definitive Digital-LongPlayAlbum 
container to be developed as the standard means of distributing digital 
albums (with full contents, not just the music but lyrics, liners, 
credits and more such as artwork and video content even...).  The goal 
will be to leverage the SPKML Language as a part of the development of
the .LPA file-type, making both the language and the file-type standard
as essential to the musical world on the web...

To view an example of the code we are developing, check out, 

https://spkml.app/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TheFlight-LPA.0.9.7.1b-STABLE.html

Note: the actual mp3 file being used, contains chapters already and as the
goal is to include forward and back buttons to skip between songs in the single
file containing all of the album contents, it will come to pass that we will add
the next and previous track buttons to the music player interface...

 Details will follow soon, so please 
 stay tuned so you don't miss your 
 chance to help design code using 
 standard code to create new standards 
 of certain file type we've been 
 working on to open-source for this 
 community being called by the name:
 SPEKTRUM Creations Development Network.

   This is an .lpa file prototype 
   containing the example code and 
   structure for the file type for 
   the album contents format being 
   developed by SCDN, led by the 
   project lead and supported by 
   all members of the dev team...
   
This contains the mp3 file of the album:

 ✈ "The Flight" ✈
 ♪ ▁▂▃▄▆██▆▄▃▂▁ ♫

This MP3 file was converted from an M4B file 
which was constructed from an AAC encoded
m4a audio file which contains Chapter markers
that are embedded in the final mp3 file in this
repository, under the file 'The%20flight.mp3'. 
this file can be imported into Apple Music or 
other music players and will allow you to go
to the previous track or the next track within
the same MP3 file.

Setting up an audio player within an HTML5
webApp Will require custom interface with the
following buttons and ui elements:

* pause/play
* stop
* previous track
* next track
* seek backward
* Seek forward
* Volume slider
* timeline transport control

SPKML.com is also his site : Since 2005.

  Note: The goal of this software’s development is to create a
  file type which acts as a container, that will be comprised of
  standardized and open-sourced code for use by anyone upon the
  release of the code, with accepting of terms by the user whom 
  may be interested in contributing to extensible additions or 
  more streamlined approaches, with a common goal to make this 
  code for use by musicians as well as by listeners for the goal
  of enhancing the ability of both parties to enjoy the final
  product, either presenting or being presented, and providing 
  a win-win scenario for everyone involved.  Please Contribute

	◦	Use W3.JS and import HTML
	◦	the content loaded in the apps content frame loads external HTML pages in the resulting app bundle once the menu items are clicked, each button loads a seperate HTML content from separated content in seperate pages and is loaded into document onLoad so nothing needs to be edited in the app index.html
	◦	Write up the liner notes: focus onproduction setuup and the processp

Documentation previously spitballed in some accurate detail in relatively close to meeting certified current html 5 / living Standard standards. Regarding the SPKML as a Language in the book called CodeBase by Christopher Johnson (c) 2004-2005 Spektrum Creations/Christopher Johnson : originally published on-demand paperback in 2005.  Also Developed as a Tiger Dashnoard app on introduction of widget Dashboard on Mac OS X 10.4 (dead link ref and removed from archive.org on last check days ago -approx. DEC16-18, 2020 cj) and as a widget also for the Yahoo widget engine later same period after Yahoo rebrand of Konfanulator exe for Windows (see next section on CodeBase & SPKML LANGUAGE ORIGINS)- - createspace AN Amazon.com on-demand paperback publishing company - republished "CodeBase" 2009 and Kindle followed in 2014??{note get correct pub date from Kindle CodeBase ebook page - get URL + add link and pub date w/version}

##CodeBase & SPKML LANGUAGE ORIGINS)-

I released the book entitled CodeBase by Chris Johnson / Christopher Johnson which Was originally released with an On demand publishing platform which I forget the name of because it's been since 2008 or nine that I've been using create space through amazon.com which is there on demand book publishing service and is still available today on amazon.com  mainly with very little if no sales because it was released in 2005. 
Interestingly the book "CodeBase" properly displayed with a titleas having or including xml/html tag brackets instead of quotes, Making it not only hard to display on the web but also making it hard to search. However CodeBase found its greatest success as a dashboard widget for the Mac and was downloaded Nearly 700 to 1000 times which means that it was read perhaps not only by consumers but also those developers who I had some sense of programming and  didn't get caught up too much in the rest of the story because it turned into a rather odd love story not involving being in love with the computer about being in love with a person who is a computer kind of matches him with and enables him to be with us anyway I digress.  I checked about a year ago or two and I was still able to find the dashboard widgets download page on apple.com however it is now nonexistent And it's not even available when you search for apple dashboard widgets downloads 

https://support.apple.com/downloads/CodeBase%2520widget

I find it oddly fascinating though that the results do represent the Mac OS updates that include combo-updates for versions of Mac OS X versions 10.3.9 to  10.4.9 which seems to coincide with and fall within the period of time that I did have that Mac and show both the tiger and panther updates which I did update both tiger and then panther on that system, very odd an AI is real now so is machine learning.
And I can there was also the Yahoo widget engine Download followed using the confabulate or engine that yahoo bought to compete with Apple's dashboard project which is now defunct as well as the Yahoo Widget engine. The only remaining widget reference that I can find besides the actual files that I have on hand on my hard drive so is this single link to cnet.com download of the file in version 1.1 format   https://download.cnet.com/CodeBase/3000-12565_4-10703449.html

In that book which is available as a Yahoo and dashboard widget, I describe in some detail a language defined by the main character which is called SPKML. Without realizing it to some degree what are you to find was more or less what I'm talking about now with the AIML Being incorporated within a specified program knowledge mark up language more special purpose knowledge markup language as it was called in the book.  

https://www.wattpad.com/story/2680784 
Wattpad.com still hosts the book as a Story available to anybody for free through their app or the web page on their website.




For the time being we are going to use MIT license and will soon append the additional BSD & W3C SOFTWARE Licenses reflecting the proper open-source conditions including retain original copyright and license and not for commercial sale, as with other structured formats covered by the W3C and its licenses for working groups like the current HTML (the Living Standard 2020/2021)  However that being the case, additionally for use by this repo team (SCDN/SPEKTRUM Creations Develoment Network), for this and other projects needing to easily declare and establish ownership and protection of intellectual property such as design layout of document structures and components and ideas regarding format, specification, guidelines of file-types including requirements of resources as it were, as one of the very next projects I plan on attacking is the creation of the first actual DBAD license to make it a legitimate court upheld document as a license that is designed to protect the developer(s) and the originator of the idea in a way that prevents people from taking ideas when they are being open-sourced...  Look up what DBAD License is if you don't know...  You SHOULD abide by such codes of conduct that shows you have a set of character traits that reflects attributes including but not limited to a common sense of decency, trustworthiness and honesty, integrity, broad common or equivien, encompassing moral values and ethics in personal and business settings...
